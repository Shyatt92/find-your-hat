#Find Your Hat#

A game written using JavaScript as a challenge set by Codecademy.

Initialise your field of play by setting the width and height of the playing field and setting the level of difficulty.

Navigate through the field using 'u', 'd', 'l', or 'r' until you either fall down a hole, or find your hat!

Enjoy!
